const longDescription = `
Schedule a word of the day (or a word at some other frequency). This command can be only used by a server admin.

You must first specify a frequency (such as **daily** or **weekly**), and then a starting time (such as **now**).

For example: **<prefix>wotd daily now**

Instead of **daily**, a custom frequency can be specified, such as **12h** for 12 hours. Supported units are **h** (hours), **m** (minutes), **s** (seconds), **d** (days), and **w** (weeks).

Instead of **now**, a custom starting time can be used, such as 15:30 (for 3:30 in the afternoon). The timezone is UTC. The starting time will be rounded to the nearest 30 minutes.

You can also optionally specific a JLPT or Kanken level, such as **N3** or **2k**.

For example: **<prefix>wotd daily now N3**

You can see all current WOTD schedules for this server by using **<prefix>wotd list**
You can clear all WOTD schedules from this server by using **<prefix>wotd clear**
You can clear the WOTD schedule for the current channel by saying **<prefix>wotd stop**
You can pause the WOTD schedule for the current channel by saying **<prefix>wotd pause**
You can resume the WOTD schedule for the current channel by saying **<prefix>wotd resume**
You can pause all WOTD schedules for this server with **<prefix>wotd pauseall**
You can resume all WOTD schedules for this server with **<prefix>wotd resumeall**
